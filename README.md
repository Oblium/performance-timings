# PERFORMANCES

## Description
A simple wrapper for [Performance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/timing)

## Usage
Basic usage is:
1. Import the library from 'performances'
  - `import Performances from 'performances'`;
2. Instantiate the Performances object providing the window.performance object and invoke the method you want to use on it
  - `var perf = new Performances(window.performance);`
  - `perf.getTotalTime(time => /* do stuffs with time */)`;

Additionaly you can import single methods to have a lower impact on your bundle size:

1. Import single methods you want to use
2. Call the method providing the callback to call on retrieve

Note: using the single methods implies a compilation of the imported code. 

## Available methods
- getPageLoad
- getNetworkLatency
- getTotalTime
